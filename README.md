# Automated Vehicle Traffic Rule Simulation (C Project)

This project is a **traffic rule simulator for autonomous vehicles**, implemented in the **C programming language**. It demonstrates the basic logic of how an automated vehicle responds to real-world traffic signals â€” RED, YELLOW, and GREEN â€” by taking appropriate actions like stopping, slowing down, or moving forward.

*##ðŸ“ˆ Overview*

As self-driving cars and smart transportation systems become the norm, it's important to simulate the core logic that governs vehicle behavior under traffic rules. This project simulates one such component â€” the reaction of a vehicle to a traffic signal.

*##ðŸ›¡âš’ Features*

- Console interface for inputting traffic light signals.
- Displays real-time vehicle decisions based on signal.
- Modular and beginner-friendly code structure.
- Easy to integrate into hardware (Arduino, 8051, etc.).
- Supports continuous simulation loop with exit option.

## ðŸ§  System Design

### Input
- User input simulating traffic lights:
  - `0` = RED
  - `1` = YELLOW
  - `2` = GREEN

### Process
- Decision-making logic using `switch-case`.
- Traffic light enum for better readability.

### Output
- Prints the vehicle's behavior in response to the signal.

```c
// Example logic:
if (signal == RED)
    Stop vehicle;
else if (signal == YELLOW)
    Slow down;
else
    Move forward;
